Artificial Intelligence is evolving incredibly fast, and with it, new terms keep popping up: **Generative AI**, **AI Agents**, **Agentic AI**. They sound similar, but each represents a very different level of intelligence and autonomy.


## Generative AI (GenAI)

Generative AI is the foundation of today’s AI boom. These models are trained on massive datasets and can **create content** — whether it’s text, images, code, audio, or even videos.


#### Core Idea

At its core, GenAI simply predicts the **next best token** (word, pixel, or code fragment) based on everything it has learned. It doesn’t “think” or “plan”; it just generates.

#### Capabilities

- Generate text (ChatGPT)
- Generate images (Midjourney, DALL·E)
- Write code, essays, designs
- Summarize, translate, rewrite
- Make designs or storyboards

#### Characteristics

- **No memory** unless added externally
- **No autonomy** → acts only when prompted
- Works in **single-turn interactions**, with no multi-step planning

#### Examples

GPT-4/5, Llama, Stable Diffusion, Claude, Gemini

## AI Agents

AI Agents take things a step forward. They use generative AI as the **brain**, but add extra components such as **tools, memory, and reasoning loops**. This allows them to perform **multi-step tasks** autonomously.

#### Core Idea

`LLM + Tools + Goals = AI Agents`
They can plan, execute, reflect, and retry — almost like a digital employee that understands what needs to be done.


#### Capabilities

- Plan → Execute → Reflect → Adjust
- Browse the web, call APIs, run code
- Multi-step task completion (RPA + AI)
- Task automation

#### Characteristics:

- Limited autonomy
- Task-oriented but still **bounded**
- Depends on LLM as “brain”
- Works in loops (ReAct, CoT, RAG, planners)

#### Examples

- GitHub Copilot Agents
- ReAct agents

## Agentic AI (next Evolution)
Agentic AI is the **future** — a more advanced class of AI systems that can **set goals, take action, learn continuously, and improve themselves**, much closer to how humans operate.
what makes it different is Agentic AI doesn’t just complete tasks — it understands long-term goals, handles ambiguity, and adapts without explicit instructions.

#### Core Idea

Autonomous systems that decide, act, learn, and self-improve.

#### Capabilities

- Maintain long-term memory  
- Self-correction and self-evaluation
- Delegation to sub-agents
- Takes proactive actions
- Learns new skills/tools over time
- Operate continuously to achieve bigger goals  

#### Characteristics

- **High autonomy** (not just task execution)
- Handles ambiguity, long-term goals
- Builds internal world models
- More robust planning & decision-making

#### Examples

- OpenAI Agentic Framework
- Devin AI (autonomous IDE developer)
- Self-driving AI workflows


### Summary

| Concept           | Meaning                              | Autonomy | Key Verb       |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|----------|----------------|
| **Generative AI** | Produces content                     | None     | *Generate*     |
| **AI Agents**     | Executes tasks using AI + tools      | Medium   | *Do*           |
| **Agentic AI**    | Fully autonomous goal-driven systems | High     | *Act + Decide* |


### Glossary

#### 1. Autonomy

> The level of independence an AI system has to operate, make decisions, and take actions **without human involvement**.
