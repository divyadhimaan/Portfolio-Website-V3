Cracking system design interviews is no longer limited to just high-level architecture. Companies today (especially product-based ones like Google, Uber, Razorpay, etc.) are increasingly emphasizing Low-Level Design (LLD) to assess your understanding of Object-Oriented Design, Design Patterns, Class Diagrams, and more.
<br></br>
In this blog, I’ll walk you through the LLD preparation roadmap, key concepts, design patterns, and common problems to practice. Plus, I’ve curated a GitHub [repository](https://github.com/divyadhimaan/lld-playground) with resources, explanations, and code samples to supercharge your prep.

## What is Low-Level Design?

Low-Level Design (LLD) refers to designing software components at the class and object level, focusing on how individual modules communicate and behave. It deals with:

- Class structures
- Object interactions
- Design principles (like SOLID)
- Design patterns (like Singleton, Factory, Strategy, etc.)
- Real-world use-case implementations

<br></br>
<br></br>

## SOLID Principles
SOLID is an acronym for five fundamental principles of object-oriented programming and design that help create more maintainable, flexible, and robust software.
- `S` - Single Responsibility Principle
- `O` - Open Closed Principle
- `L` - Liskov Substitution Principle
- `I` - Interface Segmented Principle
- `D` - Dependency Inversion Principle

## Design Patterns
- Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. 
- They represent best practices and proven approaches that experienced developers have identified and documented over time.
- Categories of design patterns include Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns.
  - `Creational Patterns`: Deal with object creation mechanisms (Singleton, Factory, Builder)
  - `Structural Patterns`: Deal with object composition and relationships (Adapter, Decorator, Facade)
  - `Behavioral Patterns`: Deal with communication between objects and assignment of responsibilities (Observer, strategy.Strategy, Command)
