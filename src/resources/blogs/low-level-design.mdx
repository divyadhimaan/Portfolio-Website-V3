# Unlocking Low-Level Design: A Complete Learning Path

Preparing for coding interviews can feel daunting — hundreds of topics, thousands of problems, and never enough time. If you’ve ever found yourself asking *“What should I study next?”* or *“Am I covering the right questions?”*, you’re not alone.

That’s exactly why we created this **curated Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) repository** — a one-stop resource to help you **practice, revise, and master** the most essential DSA concepts and problems, with a clear roadmap to guide you.

Whether you’re polishing your skills for interviews at top product companies or looking to strengthen your problem-solving foundation, this repository is designed to keep your preparation focused and effective.

## 🌟 Why This Repository?

### 600+ Most-Asked DSA Questions
The collection includes the most commonly asked interview problems across companies, chosen for their importance and variety.

### Topic-Wise Organization
From Arrays and Strings to Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, and Backtracking — every topic is covered and organized for systematic learning.

### Smart Tags

### 200 Essential Interview Problems
If you’re short on time or prefer a targeted approach, start with the handpicked set of 200 must-solve questions that cover the fundamentals.

### 20-Day Rapid Revision Plan
