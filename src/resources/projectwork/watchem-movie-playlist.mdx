  - State/Data Management: React Query / SWR  

- **Backend**:  
  - Java + Spring Boot (REST APIs)  
  - JWT-based Authentication  
  - MongoDB (Atlas) for persistent data storage  

- **APIs**:  
  - TMDb, OMDb for movie metadata

## Challenges and Learnings

A major challenge was integrating multiple external APIs while maintaining UI responsiveness and cache consistency. Ensuring secure user authentication and scalable playlist management led to deep exploration of JWT workflows and RESTful best practices. Optimizing streaming info fetch without delay required balancing third-party API rate limits and frontend caching mechanisms like SWR and React Query. The project also introduced Once UI for clean component-based design and responsiveness.


## Outcome

Watch’em successfully delivers an intuitive platform for discovering, organizing, and sharing movies. It blends modern design, social interaction, and real-time data from third-party sources to create a rich user experience. The project serves as a strong foundation for further features like collaborative playlists, watch history analytics, and notification systems — paving the way for a community-driven movie discovery ecosystem.
